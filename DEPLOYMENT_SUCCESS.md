# ðŸš€ MuscleUp Deployment Instructions

## GitHub Pages Setup (IMPORTANT - Do This Now!)

Your GitHub Actions workflow is now fixed, but you need to configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Mwoods30/MuscleUp
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- The GitHub Actions workflow should now run successfully
- Check the **"Actions"** tab to see the deployment progress
- Look for green checkmarks âœ…

### Step 3: Access Your Live App
- **URL**: https://mwoods30.github.io/MuscleUp/
- Should redirect to Sign In page
- Test with demo credentials:
  - Email: `demo@muscleup.com`
  - Password: `demo123`

## What We Fixed:
âœ… Added proper GitHub Pages permissions
âœ… Used official GitHub Pages actions
âœ… Fixed ESLint warnings
âœ… Separated build and deploy jobs
âœ… Added package-lock.json for consistent builds

## Next: Backend Deployment to Render
Once frontend is working, deploy your backend:
1. Go to **Render.com**
2. Create **Web Service** from GitHub repo
3. Root directory: `muscleup-react/backend`
4. Build: `npm install`
5. Start: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables

Your app should be live in 3-5 minutes after configuring GitHub Pages settings!
